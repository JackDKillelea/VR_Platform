# VR_Platform
A VR Platform Experience for HTC Vive (or other steamVR). Created in Unity using C#

This is a basic simulation to showcase some VR technology. You start on a platform with your VR headset on, effectivly caged in so there is no fear of falling. 

You use the left mouse button (or fire button) to move from place to place, these are predefined places in a local array (they can be changed but they are hard coded).

You can check all source code, and there is some dev code to allow for testing without a VR headset with the use of the mouse.
